# Pathfinding Demo with Dijkstra Algorithm
This demo is designed to solve mazes [like this](./maze_example.png).
I strongly recommend using this maze generator: https://keesiemeijer.github.io/maze-generator/
# A glance at the application
![Demo](./demo_1.png)
## Maze file format
The file format is PNG. The suggested maze generator has a starting and ending point near the top left and bottom right corners. The maze must have white background and black walls.
## TODO
 - Error handling
 - Maximum maze size
 - Clearing the maze viewer with a button
 - Starting new session without reloading
